Firm Offers.UpSection 2-207. Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation.]
[Section 2-207| Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation|(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to thecontract.Between merchantssuch terms become part of the contract unless:(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;(b) they materially alter it; or(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of acontractis sufficient to establish acontract for salealthough the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract.

A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor\'s due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despiteagreementotherwise.(3)Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor\'s performance.(4) An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the originalcontract.(5) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Section2-609).Section 2-209.
